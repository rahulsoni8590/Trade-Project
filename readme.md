 

Node Js: Obviously. You should be a wizard with Node Js and its ecosystem.

Express Js: We use Express for our web framework, so familiarity here is a must.

Databases: We work with both SQL (PostgreSQL) and NoSQL (MongoDB). Experience with both is a huge plus.

APIs: You should be comfortable designing and consuming RESTful APIs. Bonus points if you’ve dabbled with GraphQL.

Docker & Kubernetes: We containerize our apps and orchestrate them with Kubernetes. If you’ve got experience here, we’re already impressed.

CI/CD: Familiarity with continuous integration and deployment pipelines is essential. We like our deployments smooth and our downtime minimal.
